# ðŸŽ¨ Pigment.js [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JulienPradet/pigment.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/JulienPradet/pigment)

An attempt at building a React Framework all batteries included.

> ðŸš§ Not even an alpha yet ðŸš§

It focuses on these primary goals:

* Easily up and running
* Avoid decision bikeshedding
* Conventions over configuration
* UX & DX

## Underlying technologies

* React
* GraphQL
* Webpack
* Jest

## Inspiration

* Next.js
* Gatsby/Phenomic/Any Static Site Generator
* Create React App
* Storybook

## Why "pigment" ?

Actually, when you are thinking in terms of components, everything becomes as
composable as colors (a.k.a. pigments). That's where Pigment-Store came from (a
Storybook alternative).

And since, this framework allows you to extend the scope of your colors
(components) for you to craft beautiful apps, it only makes sense to stay with
the Pigment name.

# Stages of development

As you can see, there is still nothing here. I _strongly_ advice you _against_
using it. I don't know what I'm doing, but I'm willing to experiment how far can
it go.

My blog already has this kind of features and it will most likely migrate to
Pigment.js sooner or later.
